<p>- Allocate at least 6GB Ram to DawnCraft, 8-12 is recommended. Anything above might be a bit overboard.</p>
<p>- Make sure you have Java 18 or 17 installed, otherwise it could cause crashes.</p>
<p>- For MacOS Users, you'll need to either use the LITE version, or check out this doc if you want to play the full version: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iZ1TjJCDNyUZlEMn6S7JM_d9xQcNk2OktmxUOGdi6do/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">[Link]</a></p>
